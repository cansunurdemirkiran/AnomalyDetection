This repository is presented as a review of anomaly detection methods.

A comprehensive review of proof of concept methods based on publication and repository is included [here](https://paperswithcode.com/task/anomaly-detection).

**Anomaly**, also known as an outlier, is defined as the movement of some data outside of the behavior characteristic of the group. **Anomaly detection** methods, on the other hand, aim to detect this data outside the group characteristic.
